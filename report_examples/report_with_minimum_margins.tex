\title{A Report With Minimum Margins}
\author{Jones McAwesome}

\begin{document}

Notice the package above: 

\begin{verbatim}\usepackage{graphicx}\end{verbatim}

This forces Latex to use the entire page (with minimum margins) as opposed to the default report which uses larger margins. You want to use this on the Moody challenge.
