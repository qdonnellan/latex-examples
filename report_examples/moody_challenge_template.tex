\section{Justification of Assumptions}
Justify the assumptions made here

\chapter{Analysis, Design, \& Model Justification}

\section{Analysis}
Describe your analysis here

\section{Design}
Describe your design here

\section{Model Justification}
Include the justification for your model here. I'll also show you how to include citiations from the bibliography using \cite{lamport94} and \cite{donnellan14}. You may have to click the compile button more than once to update the citation links. The \{99\} in the bibliography just means ``reserve 2 decimal places for the reference number''; if you think you are going to have less than 10 references, you could change it to \{9\}
