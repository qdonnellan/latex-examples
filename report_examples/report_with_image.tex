\chapter{Introduction}
Here is the introduction, we're going to put an image in the first section below...

\section{A Section with 2-inch Image}
Take a look at this image! Please note, for this to work you must have an image named {\bf sampleimage.jpg} (you can of course change the image name!)

\includegraphics[width=2in]{sampleimage.jpg}


\section{A Section with a Centered Image}
This image is the same as the one above, but this time it is centered

\begin{center}
